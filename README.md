### Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tony

I'm a **Backend Engineer and Founder** building [**ScheduleBud**](https://schedulebud.app/), a production-ready micro-SaaS that leverages AI to help students manage their academic lives.

I specialize in architecting and building secure, scalable backend systems with TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Supabase, and I have hands-on experience in designing and implementing end-to-end AI pipelines (RAG, embeddings, LLM integration).

Previously, I also contributed to launching [**ACM@UCRâ€™s Hydra website**](https://github.com/acm-ucr/acm-hydra), used by 200+ members and maintained by future student developers.
