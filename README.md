### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tony Trieu

I'm a **Backend Engineer and Founder** building [**ScheduleBud**](https://schedulebud.app/), a production-ready micro-SaaS that leverages AI to help students manage their academic lives.

I specialize in architecting and building secure, scalable backend systems with TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Supabase, and I have hands-on experience in designing and implementing end-to-end AI pipelines (RAG, embeddings, LLM integration).
